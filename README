[Poker]

An algorithm that ranks a set of poker hands using TEXAS HOLD-EM rules (5 community cards, 2 private cards) for 2-6 players, and then ranks those hands from best to worst according to traditional poker hand ranking rules. 

[Usage]

php poker.php [number of players]

The script will randomly assign the number of players if not specified.

[Details]

Determining the type of hand involves using different hashes to easily determine whether there are flushes or straights. The straight determination is a bit optimized in that it looks for the presence of the min and max values given a potential range.

Function array dereferencing is used so PHP 5.4 is required.

PHPUnit 3.7.8 was used. Just run phpunit tests and it should pass all the tests.
PHP 5.4.12 was used with E_ALL set on error_reporting. No warnings raised.

[Things to improve on]

1. Make the tie-breakers more elegant. 
2. The hand type mapping feels off.
3. Use namespaces.
4. Use Symfony2's Universal ClassLoader.
